# CatKin

React/Redux + Webpack 3 template with server-side-rendering and code-splitting thanks to [Universal Component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component) and [Redux First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router). Cred goes to [James Gillmore](https://github.com/faceyspacey) for providing these awesome libraries. This template also has support for static site generation รก la [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/).

## What does it contain?

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)/[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux)
* [Webpack 3](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) - develop components in isolation from the application
* [Universal Component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component) - load parts of the application asynchronously
* [Redux First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router) - handle route changes/state the same way as any other Redux action
* [Webpack Hot Server Middleware](https://github.com/60frames/webpack-hot-server-middleware) - no `/build` folder during development, the server code is kept and re-built in memory
* [Animated Transition Group](https://github.com/faceyspacey/animated-transition-group) - nice transitions between views with loading/error states
* [Redux Actions](https://github.com/reduxactions/redux-actions) - create Redux actions/reducers in a simple way
* [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) - handles side effects and data preloading
* And some other stuff...

## Installing

When installing the project dependencies it's recommended to first [install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

**Run the installer:**

```
$ yarn install
$ cp .env.example .env
```

## Developing

The development environment utilizes [Webpack Dev Middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware), [Webpack Hot Middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware) and [Webpack Hot Server Middleware](https://github.com/60frames/webpack-hot-server-middleware) to simulate a build and handle updates. No `build/` folder will be generated during development as everything is served from memory.

**Start the development environment:**

```
$ yarn develop
```

## Developing components in Storybook

[Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) is a great environment for building React components in isolation. This gives you room to build and test your components before working on the application structure and layout. Your storybook will also work great as a component library with awesome documentation. To add a new story in your storybook just add `stories.js` in your component folder. Check `source/components/Button/stories.js` for reference.

**Start writing components:**

```
$ yarn storybook
```

## Testing

This project contains tests with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Ensyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). Check files `source/views/HomePage/__tests__/*.test.js` as reference for testing reducers, actions, sagas, selectors and components.

**Run the test suite:**

```
$ yarn test
```

**Run the test suite and get a coverage report:**

```
$ yarn test:cover
```

## Building

Before building your application you needto decide if you want to run a Node.js server or serving static html files and assets (*on Amazon for example*). The application will work equally well in both cases, but when serving a static site you need to have a strategy for re-building the assets when your data sources change. That can be solved by exposing a webhook url that runs the static site builder when called.

**Build for server-side rendering:**

```
$ yarn build:server
```

**Build static html files and assets:**

```
$ yarn build:static
```

## Serving

**Run application with server-side rendering:**

```
$ yarn serve
```

**Simulate static served site:**

```
$ yarn serve:static
```
*This will work in production, but it's recommended to put the `build` folder on a CDN (like Amazon)*

## Analyzing with Lighhouse

Measure the performance of your application with [Google Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse). This take a few seconds and will open up a new page in the browser with a complete report of your metrics like Speed, Accessibility, Best Practices etc...

**Run the analyzer:**

```
$ yarn analyze http://localhost:3000
```
